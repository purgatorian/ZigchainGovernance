### üîê Prevent Wallet Passphrase Prompts

Script prompts account password with each refresh. If you ever get tired of it follow the steps below.

Add this text to top of the script

```jsx
PASSPHRASE="12345678"

```

locate account lines: 

```bash
ACCOUNT_Z=valuser1
pv "ACCOUNT_Z" ACCOUNT_Z

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_Z=$(zigchaind keys show $ACCOUNT_Z -a)
pv "$ACCOUNT_Z account address" ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_Z

ACCOUNT_1=zuser1
pv "ACCOUNT_1" ACCOUNT_1

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_1=$(zigchaind keys show $ACCOUNT_1 -a)
pv "$ACCOUNT_1 account address" ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_1

ACCOUNT_2=zuser2
pv "ACCOUNT_2" ACCOUNT_2

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_2=$(zigchaind keys show $ACCOUNT_2 -a)
pv "$ACCOUNT_2 account address" ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_2

ACCOUNT_3=zuser3
pv "ACCOUNT_3" ACCOUNT_3

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_3=$(zigchaind keys show $ACCOUNT_3 -a)
pv "$ACCOUNT_3 account address" ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_3
```

to this:

```bash
ACCOUNT_Z=valuser1
pv "ACCOUNT_Z" ACCOUNT_Z

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_Z=$(echo "$PASSPHRASE" | zigchaind keys show $ACCOUNT_Z -a)
pv "$ACCOUNT_Z account address" ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_Z

ACCOUNT_1=zuser1
pv "ACCOUNT_1" ACCOUNT_1

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_1=$(echo "$PASSPHRASE" | zigchaind keys show $ACCOUNT_1 -a)
pv "$ACCOUNT_1 account address" ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_1

ACCOUNT_2=zuser2
pv "ACCOUNT_2" ACCOUNT_2

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_2=$(echo "$PASSPHRASE" | zigchaind keys show $ACCOUNT_2 -a)
pv "$ACCOUNT_2 account address" ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_2

ACCOUNT_3=zuser3
pv "ACCOUNT_3" ACCOUNT_3

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_3=$(echo "$PASSPHRASE" | zigchaind keys show $ACCOUNT_3 -a)
pv "$ACCOUNT_3 account address" ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_3
```

## ‚úÖ 1. `cb:6: command not found: bat`

**üìå Reason:**

`bat` is not installed. On Ubuntu, it may be installed as `batcat`.

**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:**

### ‚û§ Option 1: Check for `batcat` and symlink it

```bash
which batcat

```

If output is:

```bash
/usr/bin/batcat

```

Then run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s /usr/bin/batcat ~/.local/bin/bat
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

```

### ‚û§ Option 2: Install `bat` directly

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bat

```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. `z is not a valid name or address`

**üîç Script output:**

```bash
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
ACCOUNT_Z
ACCOUNT_Z=z
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
z is not a valid name or address: decoding bech32 failed: invalid bech32 string length 1

```

**üìå Reason:**

The value `z` assigned to `ACCOUNT_Z` is invalid. No key named `z` exists in the keyring.

**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:**

- Option 1: Create a new wallet called `z`
- ‚úÖ Option 2 (Recommended): Change `z` to an existing account like `valuser1`

### üîß Fix:

Change:

```bash
ACCOUNT_Z=z

```

To:

```bash
ACCOUNT_Z=valuser1

```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. `tx not found` Error

**üîç Command:**

```bash
  zigchaind query tx --type=[hash|acc_seq|signature] [hash|acc_seq|signature] [flags]
```

**‚ùå Error:**

```
error in json rpc client, with http response metadata: (Status: 200 OK, Protocol HTTP/1.1). RPC error -32603 - Internal error: tx (218D47F88BEC459F22695BEAE50CAA739AEE7D164E60DC53942F9833BD054654) not found
```

**üìå Reason:**

Chain ID mismatch ‚Äî script uses `zigchain` but your node is running with `zigchain-1`.

Also, this part of the returned JSON confirms the issue:

Run this command to trigger proposal manually

```bash
zigchaind tx gov submit-proposal /tmp/draft_proposal.json \
  --from=zuser1 \
  --chain-id=zigchain \
  --node=http://localhost:26657 \
  --gas-prices 0.25uzig \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  -y --output json

```

Outcome:

```bash
gas estimate: 213768
{"height":"0",
"txhash":"218D47F88BEC459F22695BEAE50CAA739AEE7D164E60DC53942F9833BD054654",
"codespace":"sdk","code":4,"data":"",
"raw_log":"signature verification failed; please verify account number (1) and chain-id (zigchain-1): (unable to verify single signer signature): unauthorized","logs":[],"info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","tx":null,"timestamp":"","events":[]}
```

**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:**

Update your script to match your actual running chain ID.

### üîß Fix:

Change this line:

```bash
CHAIN_ID="zigchain"

```

To:

```bash
CHAIN_ID="zigchain-1"

```

Ensure this matches the output of:

```bash
zigchaind status | jq -r '.NodeInfo.network'

```

## ‚úÖ 4. `unknown shorthand flag: '4' in -499999900uzig`

**üîç Script Output:**

```
4Ô∏è‚É£: zuser2 deposits to make the proposal active
Usage:
  zigchaind tx gov deposit [proposal-id] [deposit] [flags]
unknown shorthand flag: '4' in -499999900uzig

```

**üìå Reason:**

A **negative deposit amount** was calculated, which is invalid. This typically happens when:

- The current deposit already meets or exceeds the minimum
- The calculation of `DEPOSIT_REQUIRED` results in a negative number

Example:

```bash
DEPOSIT_REQUIRED=$(($MIN_DEPOSIT - $CURRENT_DEPOSIT))

```

If `CURRENT_DEPOSIT` is greater than `MIN_DEPOSIT`, this will return a negative value.

Then this gets passed to:

```bash
zigchaind tx gov deposit $PROPOSAL_ID ${DEPOSIT_REQUIRED}uzig ...

```

...causing the CLI to interpret `-` as a flag.

---

**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:**

Wrap the calculation in a **max guard** to prevent negative values.

### üîß Fix:

Update this part:

```bash
DEPOSIT_REQUIRED=$(($MIN_DEPOSIT - $CURRENT_DEPOSIT))

```

To this:

```bash
DEPOSIT_REQUIRED=$(( $MIN_DEPOSIT - $CURRENT_DEPOSIT ))
if [[ "$DEPOSIT_REQUIRED" -lt 0 ]]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Proposal already has enough deposit. Skipping extra deposit." | cb
  DEPOSIT_REQUIRED=0
fi

```

And **skip the deposit transaction** if `DEPOSIT_REQUIRED` is zero:

```bash
if [[ "$DEPOSIT_REQUIRED" -gt 0 ]]; then
  DEPOSIT_PROPOSAL_ID=$(
    echo "$PASSPHRASE" | zigchaind tx gov deposit $PROPOSAL_ID "${DEPOSIT_REQUIRED}uzig" \\
      --from=$ACCOUNT_2 \\
      "${TX_FLAGS[@]}" -y --output json | tx_id
  )
  pv "DEPOSIT_PROPOSAL_ID" DEPOSIT_PROPOSAL_ID
else
  echo "‚è≠Ô∏è  No deposit needed. Proposal already active." | cb
fi

```

---

This prevents the transaction from running with a negative amount and avoids the `unknown shorthand flag` error entirely.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. `date: invalid option -- 'j'` on Linux

**üîç Script Output:**

```
‚ú®INFO: Confirming that the voting period has started
2025-03-25T21:30:33.947163717Z
date: invalid option -- 'j'
Try 'date --help' for more information.

```

**üìå Reason:**

The script is using `date -j -f ...`, which is **only supported on macOS**. On Linux (Ubuntu, WSL, etc.), this results in an error.

The problematic code:

```bash
# macOS only
START_TIME_CLEAN=$(echo "$START_TIME" | sed -E 's/\\.[0-9]+Z/Z/')
START_TIME_EPOCH=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" "$START_TIME_CLEAN" +"%s")

```

Linux doesn't support the `-j` or `-f` flags with the `date` command.

---

**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:**

Use a **platform check** (`$OSTYPE`) to use the correct version of the `date` command based on the OS.

### üîß Fix:

Replace the existing date parsing block with this:

```bash
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
  # macOS
  START_TIME_CLEAN=$(echo "$START_TIME" | sed -E 's/\\.[0-9]+Z/Z/')
  START_TIME_EPOCH=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" "$START_TIME_CLEAN" +"%s")
else
  # Linux
  START_TIME_EPOCH=$(date -d "$START_TIME" +"%s")
fi

```

‚úÖ This ensures that both macOS and Linux users can run the script without modification.

## ‚úÖ 6. `tx not found` when querying transaction

**üîç Script Output:**

```
‚ú®INFO: Ensuring no errors in transaction
Usage:
  zigchaind query tx --type=[hash|acc_seq|signature] [hash|acc_seq|signature] [flags]

error in json rpc client, with http response metadata: (Status: 200 OK, Protocol HTTP/1.1). RPC error -32603 - Internal error: tx (A5B5B34D0829E43DED993340BDD88889D3F4C73F1F09F782CCEF04F6CE1802E0) not found

```

**üìå Reason:**

You're querying a transaction hash before it's been indexed by the node. Even if it's been broadcast, the transaction might take a few seconds to be:

- Included in a block
- Indexed for queries via `zigchaind query tx`

---

**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:**

Add a **retry loop** that waits for the transaction to appear on-chain before querying it.

### üîß Fix:

Replace this line:

```bash
TX_JSON=$(zigchaind q tx "$VOTE_ID" --output json)

```

With a retry-safe block:

```bash
TX_JSON=""
echo "‚è≥ Waiting for vote transaction to be indexed..." | cb

for i in {1..10}; do
  TX_JSON=$(echo "$PASSPHRASE" | zigchaind query tx "$VOTE_ID" --output json 2>/dev/null || true)
  if echo "$TX_JSON" | jq -e '.txhash' &>/dev/null; then
    echo "‚úÖ Vote transaction found and included in block." | cb
    break
  else
    echo "‚è≥ Still waiting... ($i/10)" | cb
    sleep 2
  fi
done

if [[ -z "$TX_JSON" ]]; then
  echo "‚ùå Failed to find vote transaction after waiting." | cb
  exit 1
fi

# Continue processing the transaction
echo -n "Raw Log: "
echo "$TX_JSON" | jq '.raw_log'

```

This loop retries up to 10 times (waiting 2 seconds each time), giving your local node time to catch up and index the transaction.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Voting Behavior: One Vote Was Ineffective, One Was Effective

### üß™ Context from the Script

The script initiates two votes:

- One from `ACCOUNT_3` (defined as `zuser3`)
- One from `ACCOUNT_Z` (defined as `valuser1`)

---

### üó≥Ô∏è First Vote ‚Äì Ineffective

```
‚ú®INFO: Getting the Proposal Votes Information and see that vote was not effective
{
  "tally": {
    "yes_count": "0",
    "abstain_count": "0",
    "no_count": "0",
    "no_with_veto_count": "0"
  }
}

```

> üü° Although the vote transaction from ACCOUNT_3 succeeded, it had no impact on the tally.
> 

---

### ‚úÖ Second Vote ‚Äì Effective

```
‚ú®INFO: Getting the Proposal Votes Information and see that vote was effective
{
  "tally": {
    "yes_count": "100000000000000000",
    "abstain_count": "0",
    "no_count": "0",
    "no_with_veto_count": "0"
  }
}

```

> ‚úÖ The vote from ACCOUNT_Z was counted and updated the tally with the full bonded voting power.
> 

---

### üîç Why This Happened

- `ACCOUNT_3` (`zuser3`) is **not a bonded (staked) account** ‚Äî it has no voting power.
- `ACCOUNT_Z` (`valuser1`) **is a staked validator account** ‚Äî its vote carries weight and is counted in the governance tally.

This follows ZIGChain governance rules (based on Cosmos SDK):

> ‚úÖ Only bonded accounts (validators or stakers) can vote with weight.
> 
> 
> üõë Accounts with no staking do not affect the proposal outcome, even if their transaction succeeds.
> 

---

### üß† Notes

- A vote can be valid on-chain but still carry **zero weight**.
- Delegators who are not staked do **not** influence the tally.
- If a delegator does not vote, it **inherits the vote of its validator** (if bonded).

---

### üìå Takeaway

| Account | Voted | Bonded? | Vote Effective? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zuser3` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| `valuser1` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

Always ensure your voting account is staked (has bonded ZIG tokens), or vote using a validator account.
