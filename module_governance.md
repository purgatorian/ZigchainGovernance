# ZIGChain Governance

ZIGChain governance is a decentralized decision-making process that allows ZIGChain users to participate in the network's future. Users can vote on proposals on a 1 ZIG 1 vote basis to change parameters, such as fees, number of validators, and other network parameters, or decide how to spent the ZIGChain funds. The governance process is essential for the decentralized nature of ZIGChain and ensures that the network evolves according to the community's consensus.

## How to create a proposal on ZIGChain Governance?

Any ZIGChain user can create a proposal on ZIGChain governance by following these steps

### Step 1: Draft a Proposal

Use the following command to draft a governance proposal. It will prompt and guide you to enter the proposal details such as title, description, and deposit amount among others.

```sh
zigchaind tx gov draft-proposal
```

The command will prompt you to select the proposal type from the following options:

```sh
‚ûú zigchaind tx gov draft-proposal
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ‚Üì ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üê
? Select proposal type:
  ‚ñ∏ text
    community-pool-spend
    software-upgrade
    cancel-software-upgrade
    other
```

If you want to make a proposal for an item that it is not on the list, you can select the "other" option and it will show the list of proposal messages types available on ZIGChain. You can select the one that fits your proposal:

```sh
‚ûú zigchaind tx gov draft-proposal
‚úî other
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ‚Üì ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üê
? Select proposal message type::
  ‚ñ∏ /cosmos.auth.v1beta1.MsgUpdateParams
    /cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgExec
    /cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgGrant
    /cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgRevoke
üîª   /cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgMultiSend
```

Follow the rest of the prompts to enter the proposal details such as title, description, deposit amount, and other relevant information.

Once process is completed, it will create two json files:

- draft_metadata.json - contains the proposal metadata
- draft_proposal.json - contains the proposal content

Take into account the following when creating your proposal:

1. The proposal deposit amount should be greater than the `minimum deposit amount * min_deposit_ratio` or `minimum deposit amount * min_initial_deposit_ratio` to be considered valid.
2. The metadata data needs to be replaced on the draft_proposal.json file. There are multiple options that you can use:
   - base64 encoded of the draft_metadata.json file
   - raw text
   - stringified json
   - IPFS link to json

Usually IPFS is the most suitable option due to the size of the metadata limitation. You can use [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud), [Web3 Storage](https://web3.storage), or any other IPFS service to upload the metadata file.

#### Uploading metadata to IPFS using Pinata (Linux)

##### 1. Get your Pinata API credentials

Go to https://app.pinata.cloud/developer.

If you don't have an account, sign up for one (it's free).

Once signed in, navigate to the API Keys section.

Click New Key, give it a name (e.g., ZIGChain Upload Key), and make sure to select Admin access or permissions for pinning files.

Copy the JWT (JSON Web Token) provided. This is what you will use to authenticate API requests.

You‚Äôll use this JWT in the next step, either directly or by storing it in a variable for convenience.

##### (Optional) Store your JWT in a variable

To avoid repeating the token, you can store it in a shell variable:

```sh
export PINATA_JWT="<YOUR_JWT>"
```

Replace `<YOUR_JWT>` with your actual Pinata token. You can now use `$PINATA_JWT` in the commands below.

##### 2. Automatically upload and update `draft_proposal.json` with the returned IPFS hash

```sh
curl -s -X POST https://api.pinata.cloud/pinning/pinFileToIPFS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINATA_JWT" \
  -F "file=@draft_metadata.json" | jq -r '.IpfsHash' | \
  xargs -I{} jq --arg cid "ipfs://{}" '.metadata = $cid' draft_proposal.json > updated_proposal.json && mv updated_proposal.json draft_proposal.json
```

3. Some proposals may require an Authority in the information provided. This field should match with the Governance Account that it is under Auth Module. To get the Governance Account, you can use the following command:

```sh
zigchaind query auth accounts
```

and look for the address in the list under `type: cosmos-sdk/ModuleAccount` with `name: gov`.

### Step 2: Submit a Proposal

... (rest of content continues)

3. Some proposals may require an Authority in the information provided. This field should match with the Governance Account that it is under Auth Module. To get the Governance Account, you can use the following command:

```sh
zigchaind query auth accounts
```

and look for the address in the list under `type: cosmos-sdk/ModuleAccount` with `name: gov`.

### Step 2: Submit a Proposal

Once you have drafted the proposal, you can submit it using the following command:

```sh
zigchaind tx gov submit-proposal draft_proposal.json --from <key-name> --chain-id ZIGChain --node <node-url> --gas-prices 0.25uzig --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

The response would provide you the transaction id in the blockchain.

If during submitting the proposal you get an error like this:

```sh
expected gov account as only signer for proposal message
```

It means that in the proposal the authority field doesn't match with the account that it is submitting the proposal. You need to update the authority field in the proposal to match the account that is submitting the proposal.

### Step 3: Confirm your proposal has been created:

To confirm that your proposal has been created, you can get the proposal id from the transaction id obtained during step 2 and query the proposal using the following command:

```sh
$PROPOSAL_ID=1
zigchaind query gov proposal $PROPOSAL_ID
```

Response Fields Explanation:

- `deposit_end_time`: The time when the deposit period ends.
- `final_tally_result`: The final tally result of the proposal. Updated once the voting period ends.
- `id`: The proposal id. Use this id to query the proposal.
- `messages`: The messages included in the proposal. It will be executed if the proposal passes.
- `metadata`: The metadata of the proposal. It can be a base64 encoded, raw text, stringified json, or IPFS link to json.
- `proposer`: The address of the proposer.
- `status`: The status of the proposal. Check below details about the possible options.
- `submit_time`: The time when the proposal was submitted.
- `summary`: A short summary of the proposal.
- `title`: The title of the proposal.
- `total_deposit`: The total deposit amount of the proposal.
- `voting_end_time`: The time when the voting period ends.
- `voting_start_time`: The time when the voting period starts.

The following are the possible proposal statuses:

- PROPOSAL_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED: The default proposal status.
- PROPOSAL_STATUS_DEPOSIT_PERIOD: The proposal status during the deposit period.
- PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD: The proposal status during the voting period.
- PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED: The proposal status of a proposal that has passed.
- PROPOSAL_STATUS_REJECTED: The proposal status of a proposal that has been rejected.
- PROPOSAL_STATUS_FAILED: The proposal status of a proposal that has failed.

If not, you can check the proposals list using the following command:

```sh
zigchaind query gov proposals
```

## Deposit and Deposit Period

Once the proposal has been created, there are two options, that the deposited amount is below or above the `minimum deposit amount`. The `minimum deposit amount` is the amount required to make a proposal acceptable to start the voting.

There is a `deposit period` that is the time that the proposal is open for deposits. If the proposal doesn't reach the `minimum deposit amount` during this period, the proposal is closed and the deposit is returned to the proposer.

Check the deposit period starting and ending time using the following command:

```sh
zigchaind query gov proposal $PROPOSAL_ID
```

To deposit on a proposal, use the following command:

```sh
zigchaind tx gov deposit $PROPOSAL_ID 1000000uzig --from <key-name>
```

Once the deposit amount is above the `minimum deposit amount`, the proposal enters the voting period.

## Voting and Voting Period

Only ZIGChain Delegators with their ZIGs bonded (staked on a Validator on the Active Set) can vote. The voting power is proportional to the amount of ZIGs bonded. The more ZIGs bonded, the more voting power the user has.

Only ZIG Bonded tokens count. If the delegator has bonded and not bonded ZIGs, only the bonded ZIGs count for voting power.

If the delegator doesn't vote, it inherits the vote of the validator it is bonded to.

When voting, the voting options are:

- Yes
- No
- No with Veto
- Abstain

To vote on a proposal, use the following command:

```sh
zigchaind tx gov vote <proposal-id> <option> --from <key-name>
```

There is also an option to vote with weights. The user can specify the percentage of the vote for each option. This is useful when there is a group behind the vote, and each member has a different opinion.

Here an example of how to vote with weights:

```sh
zigchaind tx gov weighted-vote <proposal-id> yes=0.6,no=0.3,abstain=0.05,no_with_veto=0.05 --from <key-name>
```

Once you vote, you can check the proposal vote status using the following command:

```sh
zigchaind query gov tally <proposal-id>
```

Or check your specific vote using the following command:

```sh
zigchaind query gov vote <proposal-id> <voter-addr>
```

## Voting Results

Once the voting period ends, the proposal is closed, and the final tally result is calculated.

First of all, it is necessary that the proposal reaches the quorum. The quorum is the minimum percentage of the total voting power that needs to vote for the proposal to be valid. If the proposal doesn't reach the quorum, the proposal is closed, and the deposit is returned to the proposer.

If the proposal reaches the quorum, depending on the votes we can have the following circumstances:

- Veto is reached: If the No with Veto votes are greater than the Veto Threshold (including Abstain Votes), the proposal is rejected.
- YES votes are greater than the Threshold (excluding Abstain Votes), the proposal is passed (`PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED`).
- If the YES votes are less than the Threshold, the proposal is rejected (`PROPOSAL_STATUS_REJECTED`).

Once the proposal is passed, if during the execution of the proposal an error occurs, the proposal is marked as failed (`PROPOSAL_STATUS_FAILED`).

If the proposal is passed or rejected, the deposit is returned to the proposer and those who deposited on the proposal. If the proposal was vetoed, the deposit coins are burned.

## Cancel a Proposal

It is possible to cancel a proposal if the proposer decides to do so. To cancel a proposal, use the following command:

```sh
zigchaind tx gov cancel-proposal <proposal-id> --from <key-name> --chain-id <chain-id> --node <node-url> --fees <fees> --gas <gas>
```

## Expedited Proposals

Expedited proposals are proposals that have a shorter deposit and voting period. The expedited proposals are used for urgent matters that need to be resolved quickly. The expedited proposals have a shorter voting period, and the threshold is higher than the regular proposals (requires more Yes votes).

To create an expedited proposal, you need to set the `expedited` field to `true` in the proposal data.

## Params of the Governance in ZIGChain

You can query the governance parameters using the following command:

```sh
zigchaind query gov params
```

The current params are:

```
burn_vote_veto: true
burn_proposal_deposit: false
burn_vote_quorum: false

## Proposal Types

There are different types of proposals that can be created on ZIGChain governance. The proposal types are:

- Text: A text proposal that can be used for any type of proposal.
- Community Pool Spend: A proposal to spend funds from the community pool. The community pool is a pool of funds that can be used for network development, marketing, and other purposes.
- Software Upgrade: A proposal to upgrade the software.
- Cancel Software Upgrade: A proposal to cancel a software upgrade.
- Other: A proposal for other types of proposals. This option will show the list of proposal messages types available on ZIGChain. You can select the one that fits your proposal. Any possible message supported by the ZIGChain and whitelisted can be used. ‚ùå Confirm
